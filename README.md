# entitydata
A way to set and get data on an arbituary networked entity in FiveM

## Doesn't work
This is still very much a work in progress, and right now it's pretty much useless

## NEVER MIND!

Just use [state bags](https://github.com/citizenfx/fivem/commit/637237e69bd73c154a8106a4f26af106748832d1) instead.
